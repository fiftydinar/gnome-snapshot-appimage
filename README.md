# gnome-snapshot-appimage

Test of Gnome Snapshot AppImage, not intended for daily-driving yet.

## Known issues / TO-DO

- Build `gnome-snapshot` from source instead of relying on Arch repos
- Integrate self-updater
- Opening the gallery doesn't work, something related to `glycin`
- Need to refactor it to use newer template & to not bundle `mesa`
